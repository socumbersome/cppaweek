C++14 has introduced two nice features in integer literal syntax:
* binary literals
* digit separators
Binary literals start with `0b` or `0B` and digit separator is `'`. Let's see:
```
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    int b = 0b1011;
    int big = 100'250'113;
    std::cout << b << std::endl;
    std::cout << big << std::endl;
}
```
which will give (remembering about `-std=c++14`)
```
11
100250113
```

So nice and simple :D Binary literals certainly could come useful when dealing with binary masks and separator just about always in at least 4-digit literals, improving readability.
